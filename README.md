# Web Design Challenge

In this challenge I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I'd created in a past challenge. Specifically, I plotted weather data.
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between them. I also have a landing page, a page where you can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where you can view the data used to build them.
